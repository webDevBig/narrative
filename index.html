        <p class="text">As college students, we are accustomed to going to class, taking down information, processing
            it, completing assignments, applying the information gathered, and then doing it all over again the next
            day. It can be time-consuming, stressful, and draining. You’re probably thinking, “Well, what can I do as a
            way to wind down?’ The answer to that question is quite simple. Watching interesting TV on streaming
            platforms can be just the distraction that you need. With a little help from our Instagram fans, down below
            is a list of The Buccaneer's top 10 most binge-worthy series. </p>

        <h2 class="h2_title red">2. Stranger Things</h2>
        <p class="text">If teen drama isn’t necessarily your cup of tea, then you might find more interest in the second
            show on our list. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the early 1980s, the show follows a young
            girl, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), after she escapes from a secret government co-op. This show is a great
            one to watch, especially if you’re the type of person who enjoys horror/thriller-themed shows. </p>

        <h2 class="h2_title red">3. The Vampire Diaries </h2>
        <p class="text">For those who enjoy the supernatural but need a little more romance/drama and a bit less
            DemiGorgons and Russian spies, then number three on our list is the show for you. Surrounding a complicated
            love triangle between a teenage girl and two immortal vampire brothers in the world of vampires, werewolves,
            and witches, it’s easy to see how this eight-season show became as popular as it did. Featuring a strong
            female protagonist, Nina Dobrev manages to portray a variety of emotions.</p>
